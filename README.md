# YouTube_Video_Transcriptions
 Using the youtube_transcript_api and pytube libraries to transcribe YT videos into txt files!

Just run the python file and paste in the URL you wish to transcribe. Once you hit enter, wait a few seconds and look in the same folder that you put the script in, you should see the transcribed txt file of the given video. :D

You may also need to do a pip install of these 2 libraries: pytube, and youtube_transcript_api.

Here are the commands if you want to copy and paste them in your terminal:
python.exe -m pip install youtube_transcript_api
pythonl.exe -m pip install pytube

Have fun!
