# YouTube_Video_Transcriptions
 using the youtube_transcript_api and pytube libraries to transcribe YT videos into txt files!

Just run the python file and paste in the URL you wish to transcribe. Once you hit enter, wait a few seconds and look in the same folder that you put the script in, you should see the transcribed txt file of the given video. :D
